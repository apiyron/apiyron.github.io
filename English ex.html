<p>Hi, everyone, my name is Andrey, i am 20 years old MIEM HSE undergraduate student. 
A few weeks ago I realized that programming courses in my university are not interesting how i want them to be. 
That's why I'm here, on <a href="http://heller.ru/course">heller.ru</a> trying to catch some new skills. 
I think that it's awesome when you could know some new and interesting things whenever it's challenging and fun else.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, i didn't make some last excercises because i thought that it's the good idea to know programming deeper. 
I started learn programming courses on sites like Coursera, edX, Udacity etc..
But i realized that first thing you should do to learn programming is <i>to program</i>. 
I hope that i'll find free time to finish missing exercises in new study year and will find an interesting working place at the next summmer.

<p>Thanks for reading.</p>
